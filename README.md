**SonicPersona** is an interactive web-based platform designed for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, exploring how audio design influences user trust, emotional response, and perception in AI-generated voices. This project allows users to adjust AI voice parameters (e.g., pitch, speed), evaluate their trust and emotional connection, and visualize the impact through real-time feedback.

## Features
- **Text-to-Speech Interaction**: Users input text into a textarea, and a play button synthesizes and plays the voice using web speech synthesis.
- **Real-Time Audio Adjustments**:
  - Adjust voice **pitch** (0.5x to 2x) and **speed** (0.5x to 2x) via sliders.
  - Hear immediate changes in the AI-generated voice.
- **Trust Scoring**: Users rate the voice’s trustworthiness on a 0-10 scale using a slider, capturing subjective feedback.
- **Audio Recording and Saving**: Click a “Save” button to record and download the adjusted voice as an MP3 file, including pitch, speed, and trust score in the filename.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays a real-time audio waveform and visual feedback (e.g., color changes based on trust score) to reflect audio adjustments.
